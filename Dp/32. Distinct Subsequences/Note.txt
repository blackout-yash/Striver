Tabular Dp

In leetcode, no where is mention to use mod, but, it will give runtime error without mod in tabular dp. 

But, why it passes the testcase if there no mention of mod, still we are using the mod?

The answer line lie in the line "The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.".

This lines clearly tells that the dp state which gonna affect the answer must fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

The overflow condition only occurs in those dp states which not gonna affect the answer.
